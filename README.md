#HW04A 

I started off by creating a diamond shape that is composed of 2 triangles

this code will create a grid of diamond-shaped patterns made of two triangles at random positions. Each diamond will have a random size and a random color based on the probability distribution defined in the code.

#Process: 
1st attempt: Initial idea (drawing shapes on the grid) - running the code to see a grid of rectangles - i wanted to explore with more complex shapes and colors because basic rectangle aren't visually interesting enough.
2nd attempt: Changing ths shape, I decide to use triangles to form diamond shapes instead.

3rd attempt: Add random size parameter 
4th attempe: add random colors + specific color choices for a cohensive color palatte.

#HW04B

Before I write any code, I want to make sure to clearly evaluate the the wall drawing, breaking down any elements. In this case, I know I want to create a grid of arcs on the canvas, where each arc has a random color of either blue, red, yellow, and black.

[![Untitled-Artwork-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/y6v7wRQj/Untitled-Artwork-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/t7n06sHn)

the arcs were placed in a structured grid with equal spacing, and each arc will have a random color chosen from a few pre-defined options.

Use nested loops to position elements in the grid.

Add randomization (for color, size, or other properties).

Draw the shapes using functions like arc().
