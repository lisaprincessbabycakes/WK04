# Week 04

HW04A 

I started off by creating a diamond shape that is composed of 2 triangles

this code will create a grid of diamond-shaped patterns made of two triangles at random positions. Each diamond will have a random size and a random color based on the probability distribution defined in the code.



Before I write any code, I want to make sure to clearly evaluate the the wall drawing, breaking down any elements. In this case, I know I want to create a grid of arcs on the canvas, where each arc has a random color of either blue, red, yellow, and black.

the arcs were placed in a structured grid with equal spacing, and each arc will have a random color chosen from a few pre-defined options.

Use nested loops to position elements in the grid.

Add randomization (for color, size, or other properties).

Draw the shapes using functions like arc().
